# AzureBilling
A repo with scripts to help simplify gathering billing data.  Should include both Azure PowerShell and CLI (bash shell script) types.  Leveraging the CLI as much as possible, however currently today `Get-UsageAggregates` that supports exporting usage by the hour appears to be only available in PowerShell.
